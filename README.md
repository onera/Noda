Noda is a Python package to simulate diffusion in multicomponent alloys.
It provides tools to explore thermodynamic and mobility properties of alloys
and to solve the diffusion problem using the finite difference method.

Our aim is to provide researchers and any interested people a means to study
diffusion in alloys, and to study and modify the underlying models. For help
using Noda or other inquiries, please contact the maintainer by email.

Noda is distributed under the GPLv3 license (see LICENSE.txt).

Required dependencies:

* Python 3.11+
* numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, odfpy, numdifftools

The documentation contains installation instructions, tutorials and
the package reference.
